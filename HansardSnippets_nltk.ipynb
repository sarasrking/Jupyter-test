(You may want to learn how to collect data from an API with this notebook: https://github.com/Australian-Text-Analytics-Platform/open-australia-api). We have collected some data for two parliamentarians, Katie Allen and Adam Bandt. The data supplied by the API is in the json format (Java Script Object Notation), and we need a library to handle this format.\n",

    "This is normal pattern of working in a notebook: to get data into a format which Python can proecss, we need an intermediary library. Here we need the **json** library to make a file in that format usable. Another example is reading comma-separated values files. This is a common and very useful file format - you can save a spreadsheet in this format to make a more portable data source. But Python does not 'understand' the structure of the file so the best way to deal with such files is to use the **pandas** library. This library makes it easy to work with data-frames (a kind of table) in Python and one of the functions provided by the library is **read_csv()**."

    "There are already tools that do words counts based on a list of words of interest, for example the [AntWordProfiler](https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antwordprofiler/). However, this tool relies on the user listing all the exact surface word forms. For instance, if you were interested in the word 'look', then this tool would only find the exact match 'look' and not all the morphological forms such as 'looked', 'looking', or 'looks'. We can employ lemmatisers, such as the Natural Language ToolKit (nltk) lemmatiser, to normalise the word form. You can learn more about lemmatisation and how it's different to stemming in this page: https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/stemming-and-lemmatization-1.html"
