The interface behaves like this for all paired elements: inverted commas and all type of brackets. And it doesn't matter if you type the closing element anyway, the character is not doubled.\n",
    "#### Brackets\n",
    "Regular brackets () are part of the invocation of any function or method. If the function or method requires parameters, they will be given inside the brackets; if there are no parameters, the brackets still have to be there. For example, a file object has a method to close it, which does not require parameters, so we use: **my_file.close()**. But when we create a file object (i.e. open a file), we use the general function open and we have to supply some parameters - at least the path to the file, and what we want to do with the file (read only, write, append) e.g. **my_file = open('D:/notes/python.txt', 'r')**. Often parameters supplied to such calls are formally strings - they have to be quoted - like the 'r' for 'read only' in the example.\n",
    "Earlier, we saw that *len* is a built-in function in Python, one which tells us the length of an object. We will use this to illustrate the use of brackets with a function. First we will create an object, in this case a *list*, then we will find out how long it is. In the cell below, type:\n",
    "**my_list = [2,4,6,8,10]**, go to a new line and type **len(my_list)**, then press Shift + Enter or Ctrl + Enter (afterwards, we will call this *running the cell*)."

    "The chunks of information which programs operate on (variables, lists, dictionaries etc.) are often referred to as objects. Objects typically have methods (predefined operations which apply to that class of object). Methods are specified by using the name of the object followed by a full stop followed by the name of the method followed by regular brackets. If the method requires parameters, they will go inside the brackets; if there are no parameters, the brackets still have to be there. Lists have a method called *append* - you can guess what it does - and we will use that as an example. In the cell below, type: my_list.append(12), and then on a new line: my_list, then run the cell."

    "Another example of how odd methods can seem at first is the string method *join*. This is used to turn a list of strings into a single string variable, but the string for which the method is applied is the string we want to appear between the elements, a comma or even a space. To see how this works, create a list of the words *my, name, is* and your name. Then type the line *' '.join(list)* using the name you assigned to your list as the parameter for the function.

    "You may have noticed that the names used for the objects we have created have certain characteristics. Some of these are due to constraints in programming languages: some languages do not allow names to start with a capital letter or a number, so most programmers avoid these initial possibilities everywhere. Other characteristics are due to the fact that some characters have reserved uses. As you have seen, the full stop is used to separate the names of objects and their attributes and methods (and they are also used with a special value in URLs and file names), so we generally avoid using full stops as part of a name. These are a few of the preferences you will see reflected in the names programmers use:\n",
